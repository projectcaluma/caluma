A collaborative form editing service.

## What is Caluma Service?

Caluma Service is the core part of the Caluma project providing a
[GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/). For a big picture and to learn what Caluma
does for you, have a look at [caluma.io](https://caluma.io)

## Getting started

### Installation

NOTE: We recommend using Caluma as a dedicated service. However, it is possible to integrate
Caluma into a django project. You can read about this [here](docs/django-apps.md).

**Requirements**

- docker
- docker-compose

After installing and configuring those, download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/projectcaluma/caluma/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) at
[http://localhost:8000/graphql](http://localhost:8000/graphql) which
includes a schema documentation. The API allows to query and mutate form
and workflow entities which are described below.

Caluma is a [12factor app](https://12factor.net/) which
means that configuration is stored in environment variables.
Different environment variable types are explained at
[django-environ](https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ#supported-types).

You can read more about running and configuring Caluma under
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)

### Debugging

Set environment variable `ENV` to `dev` to enable debugging capabilities. Don't use this in production as it exposes confidential information!

This enables [Django Debug Middleware](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/debug/).

For profiling you can use `./manage.py runprofileserver`. See [docker-compose.override.yml](docker-compose.override.yml) for
an example.
