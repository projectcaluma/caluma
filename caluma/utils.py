def suppressable_visibility_resolver():
    """Make a resolver that can be suppressed in the visibility layer.

    The visibility layer may cause additional load on the database, so
    in cases where it's not needed, the visibility classes can choose to
    skip filtering where it's not absolutely needed.

    For example, if the visibility of a child case is always dependent
    on the associated work item, you can disable enforcing visibility
    on that relationship.

    Example in the GraphQL schema:

    >>> class Form(FormDjangoObjectType):
    >>>     ...
    >>>     resolve_child_case = suppressable_visibility_resolver()

    Example in the visibility class:

    >>> class MyCustomVisibility(BaseVisibility):
    >>>     @filter_queryset_for(Case)
    >>>     def filter_queryset_for_case(self, node, queryset, info):
    >>>         # do the filtering as usual
    >>>         ...
    >>>     ...
    >>>     suppress_visibilities = [
    >>>         "WorkItem.child_case",
    >>>         ...
    >>>     ]

    With the above setting, when looking up child cases from work items,
    the visibility layer would not be run, and the child case would always
    be shown (if the workitem can be shown, of course).

    You may also define it as a `@property` on the visibility class. Note
    however that it's initialized on app startup, you can't change it during
    runtime and make suppression work in some cases and not in others.
